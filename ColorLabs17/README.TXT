HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Isaiah Ro
USER INSTRUCTIONS:


Try 1: I thought there weren't enough colors and some parts of the picture were too solid
Titus: Change the colors around (light and dark)

Try 2: Way too bright for me
Dad: It's blinding, add darker colors

Try 3: I liked the differences in this one more
Cousin: Make the white darker

Final: I liked this one the best, I feel like the colors blended well together and it wasn't overwhelmingly bright or dark like the others
